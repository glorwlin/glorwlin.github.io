Hi, I am Gloria! 

**A Green Notebook** is a growing document where I will explore ideas on how to develop greener technology, specifically greener machine learning. 

As a data scientist and machine learning developer who has been working at the intersection of mechanical engineering and computer science, I have witnessed how advanced technology can contribute to green living but also observed how the injudicious use of machine learning tools can lead to a waste of computational resources. Hence, I have always been asking myself this question:

**Can we make greener machine learning tools?**

I understand that it is a very big question that requires several panel discussions involving the global leaders of machine learning, but I would just like to play my part by investigating the problem based on what I have at hand. 

<!-- _"Be well prepared and raring to go"_ is my favorite idiom in my culture.  -->

<!-- It describes the _composure_ and _steadfastness_ when one prepares for the next thing in life, as well as the _confidence_ and _abundance_ when one proceeds to solve any problem that comes.  -->

<!-- In **A Green Notebook**, I will be sharing with you what I have been working on and what I am currently learning, in preparation for the coming challenges in work and life.  -->

So, in A Green Notebook, I will be sharing with you what I have been working on and what I am currently learning, in preparation for tackling the problem of green machine learning. It is supposed to be a growing document that contains my study notes and records my amenable track of thought, which, hopefully, can grow into something bigger and more valuable when the right time comes. 

Hope you find some of the materials useful:)
