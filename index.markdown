Hi, I am Gloria! 

**A Green Notebook** is a platform where I display my work and document the progress of my self-paced learning.

I am a PhD graduate in Mechanical Engineering with experience in developing data science solutions to monitor the “health” condition of wind turbine farms. During my multidisciplinary research experience, I have seen how advanced technology can promote green living by improving the operation and maintenance of renewable power plants, but I have also observed that improper use of machine learning tools can result in wasted computational resources.

In any role I undertake, I would like to minimise the use of computational resources whenever possible. That's why I created this notebook to be **green**. I hope the notebook will grow into something bigger and more valuable when the right time comes.

Hope you find some of the materials useful:)

<!-- In **A Green Notebook**, I will be sharing with you what I have been working on and what I am currently learning, in preparation for the coming challenges in work and life.  -->
