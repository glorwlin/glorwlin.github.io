Hi, I am Gloria! 

"**Be well prepared and raring to go**" is my favorite idiom in my culture. It describes the _composure_ and _steadfastness_ when one prepares for the next thing in life, as well as the _confidence_ and _abundance_ when one proceeds to solve any problem. 

In A Green Notebook, I will be sharing with you what I have been working on and what I am currently learning, in preparation for the coming challenges in work and life. It is supposed to be a growing document that contains my study notes and records my amenable track of thought, which, hopefully, can grow into something bigger and more valuable when the right time comes. 

Hope you enjoy the journey into my mind:)
