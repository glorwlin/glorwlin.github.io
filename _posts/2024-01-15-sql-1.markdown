As a researcher who has spent four years developing machine learning algorithms for specific engineering problems, I am so surprised that I have never learnt SQL before. So SQL became the topic of my first personal learning project. 

To get a rough idea of what SQL is, I gathered some (interesting) facts that satisfied my curiosity. 

Background
SQL or SEQUEL?
    • SEQUEL – Structured English QUEry Language 
        ◦ SQL was first created at IBM in early 1970s, with the original name being SEQUEL. 
        ◦ But SEQUEL was already trademarked by an aeroplane company..
    • SQL – Structured Query Language
        ◦ The registered acronym in the end. 

How to pronounce it?
    • Many pronounce it as “sequel” for historical reasons. 
    • The most popular pronunciation among non-English programmers is S-Q-L.
