## What is a database management system?
- **Database** -- logically modelled clusters of information/data
- **Database management system (DBMS)** -- a computer program that interacts with a database
- Every DBMS has an underlying model that structures how data are stored and accessed. 
    - e.g. relational database management system &larr relational data model

## The structure of a relational database management system (RDBMS)
- Relational -- data are organised into tables. 
- Tables = relations 
- A _relation_ is a set of tuples.
- A _tuple_ is a row in a table. 
- Each tuple shares a set of attributes.
- An _attribute_ is a column in a table. 

## Variations of SQL
- SQL is used to manage and query data from relational databases. 
- Many RDBMSs use their own particular dialect of SQL. 
- The standard SQL exists. 
    - SQL standards are jointly maintained by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
