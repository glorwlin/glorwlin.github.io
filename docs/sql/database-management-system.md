## What is a database management system?
- **Database** – logically modelled clusters of information/data
- **Database management system (DBMS)** – a computer program that interacts with a database
- Every DBMS has an underlying model that structures how data are stored and accessed. 
    - e.g. relational database management system ← relational data model

Relational database management systems
    • Relational – data are organised into tables. 
    • Tables → relations 
    • A relation is a set of tuples.
    • A tuple is a row in a table. 
    • Each tuple shares a set of attributes.
    • An attribute is a column in a table. 
Structured query language (SQL)
    • used to manage and query data from relational databases
    • Many RDBMSs use their own particular dialect of SQL. 
    • SQL standards are jointly maintained by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
