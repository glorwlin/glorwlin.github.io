# Fundamentals of Machine Learning
{: .no_toc }

Over the past five years, I have been developing machine learning (ML) solutions to engineering problems, with a focus on Gaussian process (GP) and its applications to fluid modelling. Although I enjoyed every second of my research journey, sometimes I do question my decision on attempting to takle one of the hardest-to-solve equations using a difficult-to-scale algorithm. As a researcher, I consider this an interesting problem and am excited to solve it. However, moving away from academia, I start to face adversity as neither GP nor fluid dynamics is an area "popular" enough to be continuously hiring people, not to mention the combination of the two. Fortunately (or unfortunately), I am naive enough to believe that what I have learnt will be of importance one day.

As the world continues to love neural networks (for a reason, I believe), I would love to look into ways to connect and combine GP and NN and discover how such methods can be applied. In this section of the Notebook, I will dive into the fundamentals of GP and NN and discuss how they can be combined to better solve engineering problems.
