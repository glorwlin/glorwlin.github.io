Hi, I am Gloria! 

"**Be well prepared and raring to go**" is my favorite idiom in my culture. It describes the composure and steadfastness when one prepares for the next thing in life, as well as the confidence and abundance when one proceeds to solve any problem. 

In The Green Notebook, I will be sharing with you what I have been working on and what I am currently learning, in preparation for the coming challenges in work and life. It is supposed to be a growing document that contains my study notes and records my amenable track of thought, which, hopefully, can grow into something bigger and more valuable when the right time comes. 

Hope you enjoy the journey into my mind.
