# Weijiang (Gloria) Lin, PhD, MBCS

I am a PhD graduate in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Sheffield, with industry experience as a Data Scientist Intern at Rolls-Royce and customer-facing volunteer experience at local charities. 

My research story began with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, where I became interested in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). To explore how data-driven methods improve CFD models, I pursued a master’s in Data Analytics, where I proposed and developed a data-enhanced CFD model for my dissertation. During my master’s, a coursemate and I placed runner-up in the Rolls-Royce Data Storytelling Challenge out of 500 teams, earning internships as a prize. As a Data Scientist Intern at Rolls-Royce, I was instrumental in developing an engine health prediction model using Python as part of a software development team of five. These experiences piqued my interest in hybrid physics-data modelling, leading me to an EPSRC-funded PhD exploring physics-informed machine learning for wind farm modelling.
