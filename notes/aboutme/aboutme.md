I am a PhD graduate in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Sheffield, with industry experience as a Data Scientist Intern at Rolls-Royce and customer-facing volunteer experience at local charities. 

My research story began with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, where I became interested in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). To explore how data-driven methods improve CFD models, I pursued a master’s in Data Analytics, where I proposed and developed a data-enhanced CFD model for my dissertation. During my master’s, a coursemate and I placed runner-up in the Rolls-Royce Data Storytelling Challenge out of 500 teams, earning internships as a prize. As a Data Scientist Intern at Rolls-Royce, I was instrumental in developing an engine health prediction model using Python as part of a software development team of five. These experiences piqued my interest in hybrid physics-data modelling, leading me to an EPSRC-funded PhD exploring physics-informed machine learning for wind farm modelling. 

My PhD was in the context of renewable energy (offshore wind), where I developed data science solutions to monitor the “health” condition of wind turbine farms. Early in the project, I collaborated with a wind farm operator in Denmark, making several trips to obtain data and present findings. The company provided large, messy time-series data recorded at low frequencies. I quickly mastered their data management systems and curated a dataset, with written descriptions, for my research. When COVID-19 restricted data access, I adapted by focusing on developing modelling techniques with available data instead of solving real wind farm damage detection problems, with the support of my supervisors and colleagues. 

Despite the challenges, I developed a state-of-the-art probabilistic method for monitoring wind farm performance by incorporating wake propagation physics into Gaussian process models. My work led to a first-author journal paper in Data-Centric Engineering (impact factor: 3.6), four first-author conference papers and presentations at top international conferences, and recognition for the best PhD student presentation at the 2021 EPSRC Prosperity Partnership annual meeting. Additionally, I co-authored a journal article and two conference proceedings with colleagues. 

I have gained experience in delivering live training and teaching sessions both within and outside my professional area. As a postgraduate student, I volunteered at research outreach events explaining my research in layman’s terms and delivered two seminars during my PhD (in addition to the conferences and meetings). After my PhD, I started volunteering as a Small-Group Teacher, Event Facilitator, and Planner and at local charities. I am part of two leadership teams, planning and delivering teaching sessions to international students, researchers, and visiting scholars on a rota basis. Additionally, I facilitate weekly couch chats and occasionally moderating panel discussions. I also organized social events for groups of 10 to 40 people, emphasizing cultural exchange and rapport building. 

As a global citizen who has lived on three continents (Asia, Oceania, and Europe), I am naturally inclined to contribute to international projects and collaborate with diverse teams.
