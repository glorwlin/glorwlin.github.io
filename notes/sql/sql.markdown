# Introduction to SQL
{: .no_toc }

As a researcher and machine learning specialist with five years of experience, I have not utilised any well-known database management systems in my projects. This is primarily because my work has centered around developing algorithms tailored to solve specific problems using curated datasets. However, recognising the importance of understanding data management and curation processes, I have chosen SQL as the subject of my first personal learning project. Understanding SQL will provide insights into developing algorithms that are optimised for specific datasets.
