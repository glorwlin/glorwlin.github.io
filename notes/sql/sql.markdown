# Introduction to SQL
{: .no_toc }

As a researcher and a machine learning specialist for 5 years, I have not yet used any of the well-known database management systems during any of my projects. It is partially because the main focus of my work has been on developing algorithms to solve specific problems given curated data sets. However, an understanding of how data are managed and curated may also provide insights into how an algorithm can be developed for a specific data set, which is why SQL has become the topic of my first personal learning project.
